###  ðŸ‘‹ Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Martin, a JS Full-Stack developer living in Montreal.

ðŸŒ± After being an aerospace engineer for years, I decided to take my career in a new direction and deep dive into web development. Definitely the best decision of 2021, I have leared a ton of fascinating things and I am now working primarily as a back-end software developper at Heyday By Hootsuite

Current Roadmap:
- ~~**2020: Survive a global pandemy**~~
- ~~**2021: Gain a deep understanding of MERN/PERN stacks and perfect my coding skills**~~
- ~~**2022: Become a professional web developer!**~~ Got hired at Heyday.ai as a back-end software engineer
- Keep learning and improving

ðŸŽ¨ As a digital artist, I also create numerical art ranging from interactive art installations to drawings pen plotted with my trusty AxiDraw. You can find some of my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/croc0smos/).

 Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, feedback on a project or just want to chat !
